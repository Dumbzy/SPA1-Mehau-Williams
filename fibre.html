				<p>Since late October of 2009, <a href="https://www.chorus.co.nz/" target="_blank">Chorus</a> has been rolling out Fibre all over the nation. In the Wellington CBD fibre optic cables can be seen suspended to various buildings, and poles. Although not restricted to but very common in suburban areas these fibre optic cables can be installed and routed underground. As of right now Chorus have completed 80% of their commissioned rollout for fibre; connecting over 1 million homes with fibre internet.</p>

				<p>Fibre optics is a technology which was developed more than half a century ago and as late as the 1970's, was used to transmit information. Recent innovations has allowed us to use this technology in creating fast and powerful networks; distributing information at very fast speeds. In the Wellingto Region, we have access to various fibre plans ranging from speeds of 15mbps to 1gbps.</p>
